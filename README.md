To convert an ECM file to BIN :-
Drag and drop the ECM file on unecm.exe in this folder. It will start decoding the ECM file and once it's
succesfully decoded, check the foloder where the ECM file was, a new BIN file will be made, that's the
converted version of that ECM file and now you can use it or burn it on a CD/DVD

Make an ECM file from a BIN file :-
Just the opposite, Drag and drop the BIN file in ecm.exe in this folder and it will start encoding it
to an ECM file, once it's completed a new ECM file will be created at the folder where the BIN file is.
