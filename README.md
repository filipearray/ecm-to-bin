To convert an ECM file to BIN: Drag and drop the ECM file onto unecm.exe in this folder. It will start decoding the ECM file, and once it's successfully decoded, check the folder where the ECM file was. A new BIN file will be created; that's the converted version of the ECM file, and now you can use it or burn it onto a CD/DVD.

To make an ECM file from a BIN file: Just the opposite. Drag and drop the BIN file onto ecm.exe in this folder, and it will start encoding it to an ECM file. Once it's completed, a new ECM file will be created in the folder where the BIN file is.
